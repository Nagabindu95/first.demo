	 			  <p>  hey....all! I possess a diverse skill set in programming and web development, with proficiency in several key languages and tools. I am well-versed in C and C++, which provide me with a solid foundation in low-level programming and memory management. Python and Java are languages I have a strong grasp of, offering versatility and ease in application development. I am proficient in web technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with the added ability to work with TypeScript for robust front-end development.</br></br>
I have experience in PyQt5, which allows me to create desktop applications with a Python backend, combining functionality and user-friendly interfaces. In the realm of computer vision, OpenCV is a tool I am skilled in, enabling me to work with image processing and machine learning. For web development, I have a good understanding of Django, a powerful Python web framework, and various other backend tools that help me build scalable and efficient applications.</br>
</br>

In summary, my expertise spans a wide spectrum, from low-level programming in C and C++ to high-level languages like Python and Java, web development with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and even specialized areas like computer vision with OpenCV. These skills, complemented by my knowledge of PyQt5 and Django, allow me to create diverse and robust software solutions.</br></p>
